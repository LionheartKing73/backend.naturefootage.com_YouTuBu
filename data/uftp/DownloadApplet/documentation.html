                <h2>1 Overview</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3 id="requirements">1.a Requirements</h3>
                    <p>FileCatalyst will run on any Windows, Linux, OS X, or Solaris/Sparc computer that
                        can run Java 1.4 or higher.  Please visit <a href="http://java.com">http://java.com</a> to get the latest
                        version of Java for your platform.</p>

                    <p>To run a FileCatalyst applet, the user will need a web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari) which has been enabled with
                        Java Plugin version 1.4 or later.  Once you have installed the applet, you may navigate to the install path to see the sample page.  For example,
                        if the files are at /wwwroot/filecatalyst then you would access the applet through http://www.server.com/filecatalyst , substituting your
                        own domain or IP address for "www.server.com". The browser will find the "index.html" page and load it, which will in turn load the applet. </p>

                    <h3 id="installation">1.b Installation Procedure</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Unzip/decompress FileCatalyst Applet package (e.g. &ldquo;fc_applet.zip&rdquo;).</li>
                        <li>Save the contents to an appropriate directory on your website (for example, &ldquo;/uftp&rdquo;).</li>
                        <li>Add the following 2 lines to the webpage that will contain the applet in this order:
                            <blockquote><pre>&lt;script language="JavaScript" src="deployJava.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></blockquote>
                            <blockquote><pre>&lt;script language="JavaScript" src="fcdownload.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></blockquote>
                            The included document &ldquo;fcdownload.html&rdquo; offers an example of usage.  Change the src=&ldquo;fcdownload.js&rdquo; to include the relative path, unless the webpage and the applet are located in the same directory.  for example, it might become:  <span class="code">src="../uftp/fcdownload.js"</span></li>
                        <li>Modify the JavaScript file (&ldquo;fcdownload.js&rdquo;) to suit your needs, according to the parameters outlined in the next section of this guide.</li>
                    </ol>


                    <h2>2 Configurable Parameters</h2>
                    <p>
                        The following section describes the JavaScript parameters defined in the fcdownload.html page. They include both manditory parameters (server, port, user, password) and optional features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Note:</em> For a JavaScript-only headless applet, please refer to the additional examples provided in the <em><strong>live.html</strong></em> or <em><strong>ajax_sample.html</strong></em> pages included in the applet bundle.

                                        will decrypt them and perform the login. The encryption is based on a key value that is specified by
                                        the "ek" parameter below. To generate encrypted parameters, use encrypt.html, included with the applet.
                                        This provides at least some measure of protection from prying eyes.

                                        easily be able to sniff the network to retrieve user and password info regardless of encryption done
                                        in the HTML. Use SSL on the FileCatalyst server to ensure full security.</p>

                                        Performing an MD5 on the entire file (after transfer is complete) is a more standard approach, but can result in
                                        the transfer appearing to pause, especially on high bandwidth transfers verifying large files are performed.

                                    <p>
                                        On-the-fly MD5 calculations are performed after each block (or file part) is saved to the disk.  These are done
                                        while data is still being transferred on the network by other threads, resulting in a smoother network usage.

                                        Concurrent MD5 offloads file verification to another connection, resulting in complete utilization of networking

                    <h2>3 Performance Tuning</h2>
                    <p>Tuning your FileCatalyst Software for performance requires knowledge of your system,
                        network and usage scenario.</p>
                    <p>There is no magic &quot;optimize for all&quot; button.</p>
                    <p>This section attempts to address a few common scenarios encountered by clients, and
                        seeing where improvements can be made to allow greater throughput.</p>

                    <div>

                            <h4>Disk IO</h4>
                            <p>Achieving high throughput transfers requires first and foremost that you have the
                                physical ability to read/write to data at the speeds you are trying to transfer.</p>
                            <p>FileCatalyst HotFolder and Remote Server Admin now include features that allow you to
                                test write speed of your system. Running a file IO test with those applications can help determine if your system
                                itself can keep up with the amount of data being written. You may use the results to help tune FileCatalyst applets.</p>
                            <p>If the IO speed is not what you expected, verify the following:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Ensure that the user home directory (or HotFolder location) is pointing to the
                                    correct path.</li>
                                <li>If the mount point is a network drive (Samba, SAN), make sure that the networking
                                    infrastructure can support the capacity (i.e.: Gbps ISCSI mounted via a 100 Mbps
                                    switch)</li>

                                bottleneck high speed transfers.</p>
                            <p>Encryption of the control channel alone does not impose significant overhead. However,
                                setting the FileCatalyst Server to use encryption on the control + data channel does
                                impose a performance (CPU) penalty.</p>
                            <p>A typical client or server machine can handle transfer speeds of 100
                                Mbps. However, hitting higher speeds (&gt;500 Mbps) becomes difficult if the data channel
                                is encrypted, with transfer starting to become CPU-bound. This may be verified by running an
                                Activity Monitor (i.e. &quot;Task Manage&quot; on Windows or &quot;top&quot; on Linux) for your
                                OS and checking the CPU usage while the transfer is occurring. </p>
                            <p>Depending on your workflow, a possible solution to overcome this would be to
                                encrypting the data BEFORE transferring it over the wire, and decrypt it once the data
                                has reached its destination.</p>
                            <p>Compressing files can also be CPU intensive. Under most circumstances, the gain in
                                network throughput outweighs the CPU overhead to zip up files before transfer, especially
                                when files are text based and can be highly compressed. However, compression should be
                                avoided for most binary and media files, which are normally considered non-compressible.
                                If compression AND AES on the data channel are utilized, high speed transfers are likely
                                to be limited by the amount of computing power that can be assigned for each
                                transfer.</p>

                        <h3 id="knowYourBandwidth">3.b Know Your Bandwidth</h3>
                        <p>FileCatalyst HotFolder has the ability to test the bandwidth between itself and the
                            server. It is recommended that this test be run if you are unsure of the real network
                            bandwidth. The results of the test may inform applet configuration.</p>
                        <p>If there is a network bottleneck between the client and the server, setting the
                            bandwidth speed above the real network capacity may result in high level of dropped
                            packets and slower overall throughput.</p>
                        <p>If the bandwidth is above 500 Mbps and the supporting disk IO can support these speeds,
                            it is recommended that client application specify UDP sender streams to be 2 or greater.
                            This allows more data to be pushed out of the system, and provides higher maximum speeds.</p>

                        <p>Once the bandwidth is known, other settings can now be adjusted to accommodate your

                            <h4>Congestion Control: Play nice with TCP, or give it the boot</h4>
                            <p>Our UDP protocol has the ability to be very friendly to other traffic sharing the
                                network resource. It also has the ability to push out any other traffic and try to attain
                                maximum line speed at all costs. Both of these are valid scenarios, and it is important
                                to understand the impact this can have on your transfers.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>For typical shared land-line networks (where other traffic is also present), UDP
                                    transfers should enable congestion control. This allows the protocol to react to packet
                                    loss (possibly due to other TCP traffic) in a friendly manner, and slow down the rate of
                                    transfer to allow multiple traffic sources to share the line.</li>
                                <li>By default, the congestion control value is set to 2 (low aggressive rate), which
                                    reacts fairly quickly. When other traffic is detected, transfer rates should come down
                                    quickly and play nice. The start rate should also be set to be the minimum speed which
                                    you know the line is capable of handling.</li>
                                <li>For dedicated land-line networks, customers often turn on the congestion control, but
                                    set the aggression much higher (5, or halfway), with the start rate at half the known
                                    link speed. This allows the file transfer to ramp up quickly, and maintain high rates
                                    should other traffic try to share the line. The higher the aggressive rate, the more the
                                    protocol will kick out any other TCP/UDP traffic on the line.</li>
                                <li>For improved line speed, set the network upload/download to known link capacity,
                                    minimizing the software from exceeding the network and causing continuous peak/valley
                                    from the congestion control.</li>
                                <li>For maximum line speed, disabling congestion control removes most overhead from the
                                    UDP protocol. However, if the software exceeds the link capacity, any dropped packets due
                                    to network slowdown are amplified, increasing the risk of all sender threads entering
                                    retransmission mode increases (slows down transfer rate temporarily).</li>
                                <li>For satellite transfers, packet loss could simply be caused by an object passing
                                    quickly between the dish and the satellite, or momentary electrical/solar interference.
                                    For these types of connections, customers often turn off congestion control altogether,
                                    preferring to power through any temporary loss of signal and not risk slowing down the
                                    connection.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>Compensate for Packet Loss</h4>
                            <p>Performance can be further optimized if you know your levels of packet loss.</p>
                            <p>The FileCatalyst protocol performs error correction should some packets not arrive on
                                first attempt. However, retransmission of data blocks is much slower and
                                latency-sensitive than the original sending of data. To compensate for this slower
                                retransmission period, our algorithm employs multiple sender threads to send out the
                                data, increasing probability that at least one sender is able to send data at full rate
                                while the other threads clean up any missing packets.</p>
                            <p>For high packet loss, it is recommended that more threads be deployed, each with a
                                smaller block size. This greatly decreases the possibility that one particular transfer
                                finds all its sender threads in &quot;retransmission&quot; mode, slowing the throughput down.</p>

                            <h4>Compensate for High Latency</h4>
                            <p>To compensate for high latency, it is recommended that block sizes (the amount of data
                                each sender thread can manage at one time) be increased, or that the amount of threads be
                                increased. Each of these allows more data to be in-flight, before a callback is initiated
                                to see if packets must be resent.</p>
                            <p>There is a simple equation to know the minimum values required to saturate a
                                particular line:</p>
                            <p><span class="monospace">RTT * bandwidth &lt;= numSenderThreads * blocksize</span></p>
                            <p><em>i.e.</em> RTT is 250ms, and your line speed is 100000 Kbps. numSenderThreads *
                                blocksize should be greater than 25000000 bytes, or roughly 25 MB. Setting
                                numSenderThreads set to 3 (default), you need a minimal block size of 8333333 to keep the
                                line always full, or a little over 8MB.</p>
                            <p>To compensate for potential packet loss, it is recommended that the thread value be
                                increased by at least 1 thread to ensure that one sender thread is always transmitting a
                                new block of data.</p>

                            <h4>Increase OS TCP/UDP Buffers and Window Sizes</h4>
                            <p>Most operating systems allow the administrator to configure TCP/UDP parameters.
                                Increasing the number of packets that may be in-flight may result in fewer lost packets,
                                thereby increasing performance.</p>

                        <h3 id="knowYourData">3.d Know Your Data</h3>
                        <p>FileCatalyst products supports many tools to decrease the amount of data that is
                            required to be sent across the network. The exact combination of features to utilize and
                            increase file transfer performance depends on the nature of the data being sent across
                            the network.</p>

                        <div>
                            <h4>Archive Small Files Together</h4>
                            <p>Each individual file transfer, regardless if the file is 50 GB or 1 kb, requires
                                overhead to setup a network connection between the client and the server. For large
                                files, this overhead has minimal impact, as the software will spend most of the time
                                transferring data across the wire. For transfers of small individual files however, the
                                reverse is true: the software can spend most of the time setting up and tearing down a
                                connection, only to transfer a directory full of many small files.</p>
                            <p>It is recommended that if transfers consists of many small files, that compression be
                                turned on and that the &lsquo;compress files into single archive&rsquo; option be enabled. This can
                                significantly increase performance, as now the application will spend all its time
                                transferring data instead of managing ports and network connections. Enabling progressive
                                transfers will also allow the application to start transferring even as the single
                                archive is being built.</p>
                            <p>There are caveats to single archive transfers to keep in mind. Should a transfer be
                                interrupted, auto-resume will does not work, and restarting the transfer will start the
                                archive/transfer from the beginning. Also, delta file transfers (incremental) does not
                                work.</p>
                            <p>It is therefore recommended to enable the &quot;Max size&quot; feature for the single archives. This will create several smaller archives and extract them as they are transferred. If the transfer is interrupted, generally some of the file will have already been transferred. </p>

                            <h4>Compress Text Files</h4>
                            <p>FileCatalyst clients allow files to be compressed before being sent out. Transferring
                                of text files (logs, emails, etc) should be compressed before being transferred. The CPU
                                overhead of compression is negligible compared to the bandwidth savings of compressing an
                                ASCII based file. It is recommended that progressive transfers be set when compression is
                                used. This allows the file to be sent over even as it is being compressed, reducing the
                                overall transfer time.</p>
                            <p>Media files (audio, video, images) however do not compress easily, and often add
                                intensive computing overhead to a transfer while giving no bandwidth savings. Ensure that
                                non-compressible files are filtered out by using the file compression filter.</p>

                            <h4>Delta File Transfer</h4>
                            <p>If the same file is sent out more than once (perhaps with only a small modification to
                                the file), enabling incremental delta transfers will significantly reduce the bandwidth
                                involved in sending a file.</p>
                            <p>For large files, it is also recommended to turn on progressive transfers. This allows
                                the file deltas to be transferred. even as they are being built on the server, reducing
                                the time it takes for the file to be transferred.</p>
                            <p>If the same file contains entirely new data each time (example: logs truncated on
                                daily basis, and uploaded using the same file name), it is recommended to disable
                                incremental transfers and simply start to transfer the file as new (avoid the computation
                                required to determine what is different in the file, as all of it has changed).</p>

                            <h4>MD5 on-the-fly</h4>
                            <p>MD5 calculations are able to be conducted as each chunk of data is being received.
                                This allows the application to perform calculations in parallel with the data transfer,
                                and skips the otherwise long MD5 done at the end of the file transfer.</p>

                        <div>
                            <h4>Low bandwidth clients</h4>
                            <p>For clients connecting with low bandwidth, ensure that the congestion control start
                                rate is set below the maximum line speed. By default, the value for the start rate is
                                384kbps, or the speed of a slower residential DSL/Cable connection. If the congestion
                                control rate is still higher than available bandwidth, the application will quickly flood
                                the network connection, producing lost/dropped packets and forcing the sender threads to
                                perform most of its transfer in retransmission mode (slower).</p>
                            <p>For very low bandwidth clients and low latency transfers, FTP mode can at times
                                perform faster transfer rates than UDP.</p>
                            <p>Using our <a href="http://www.filecatalyst.com/products/comparison_tool.html">on-line
                                    comparison calculator</a>, you can see if there is an advantage to using FTP rather then
                                UDP. Note, however, that the values in the on-line calculator do not take high packet
                                loss into account. TCP at high latency is extremely sensitive to even 0.1% packet loss,
                                while our UDP protocol handles this much more gracefully.</p>

                            <h4>High Load Servers (or lots of clients)</h4>
                            <p>Transferring UDP at high speed is memory intensive. Using the example listed above, a
                                250ms transfer (LA to Hong Kong) at 100 000 Kbps requires a minimum of 25MB of data to be
                                in-flight at any one time.</p>
                            <p>For a standard install of FileCatalyst Server the default memory allowed is 1GB. This means the system can likely accept
                                around 40 concurrent connections at full speed before starting to run short of memory
                                resources.</p>
                            <p>The key to getting the FileCatalyst Server to accept higher numbers of concurrent
                                connections is to lower the memory footprint each connection can take on the system.
                                The server has an option via the Server Remote
                                Administration to optimize for concurrency. This will lower the maximum thread count and
                                block size each client connection consumes, resulting in the server able to accept more
                                clients at any one time.</p>
                            <p>If the maximum sender thread and maximum block size is set too low, limiting clients
                                from connecting at full bandwidth, the following may be done:</p>

                            <h4>Limiting Concurrent Connections</h4>
                            <p>The FileCatalyst Server allows setting the maximum concurrent user connections to
                                levels below what the license allows. This allows administrators the possibility of
                                setting the memory footprint high for each client, but limiting the connections to ensure
                                that the server does not itself start to run short of memory.</p>

                            <h4>Increase Java Heap Size</h4>
                            <p>The optimizations performed for high-load servers are based upon your existing
                                available JAVA heap size. Increasing the memory footprint JAVA is allowed to consume will
                                increase the number of threads or block sizes each transfer may consume.</p>
                            <h5>Windows Service</h5>
                            <p>For FileCatalyst Servers running as a service, these may be
                                configured in fcconf.conf:</p>

                        <h3 id="configuringControl" >4.a Configuring for the Control Connection</h3>
                        <p>In all but the strictest of environments, the client side's firewall does NOT need to be configured. If your environment
                            has outgoing TCP blocked (extremely rare), the IT department will need to allow outgoing TCP connections on port 21, or
                            whatever other port has been set as the server listen port in the server configuration. You can test connection by
                            clicking the &quot;Test settings&quot; button. </p>

                        <h3 id="configuringData" >4.b Configuring for the Data Connections</h3>
                        <p>Again, client-side firewall configuration is rare. In the &quot;Transfer Options&quot; tab of the Task Edit view, incoming UDP is
                            set to port &quot;0&quot;, which is an alias for &quot;passive&quot;. In other words, HotFolder will tell FileCatalyst Server which port to
                            use in order to make the data connection. The most common scenario requiring firewall configuration is UDP-based download.
                            If the client-side is failing on UDP download, the next step is to specify a data port. In the &quot;Transfer Options&quot; tab,
                            specify an arbitrary available port. </p>

                    <h2>5 Regular Expressions</h2>
                    <p>
                        FileCatalyst utilizes Java regular expressions, allowing you to build complex file filters to select which file you want to include in a transfer.
                    </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Transfer only files that end with ".dat".  Windows wildcard equivalent of "*.dat"
                                <blockquote><pre>.*\.dat$

Explanation:
.* --> any character, 0, 1, or multiple times
\. --> followed by a period (you must escape dot character, or it will be treated as a wild card)
dat --> the exact characters dat all lowercase
$ --> must be at end of line</pre></blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>Transfer sound files (.mp3 or .wav) with numbers in the title
                                <blockquote><pre>.*[0-9]+.*\.(mp3|wav)$

Explanation:
.* --> any character, 0, 1, or multiple times
[0-9]+ --> is any numerical digit one or more times
.* --> any character, 0, 1, or multiple times
\. --> followed by a period (you must escape dot character, or it will be treated as a wild card)
(mp3|wav) --> last characters may match exactly "mp3" OR "wav" -- all lowercase
$ -->; must be at end of line</pre></blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>Transfer everything except temporary files ending in ".tmp"
                                <blockquote><pre>.*\.[^(tmp)]$

Explanation:
.* --> any character, 0, 1, or multiple times
\. --> followed by a period (you must escape dot character, or it will be treated as a wild card)
[ --> Start of a block
^(tmp) --> exclude files with "tmp" in the name
] --> end the block
$ --> must be at end of line</pre></blockquote>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><em>Note:</em> Because JavaScript will try to interpret some characters, the following actions must be taken into consideration:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You must double up backspace characters (JavaScript inteprets a single backspace as an escape character)</li>
                            <li>convert any &quot;+&quot; signs as &quot;%2B&quot;, as they will be removed by JavaScript (into spaces)</li>
                            <li>convert any &quot;%&quot; into &quot;%25&quot;, as the JavaScript may not start up</li>
